	/// they may need additional fees to be attached through a child transaction using the popular
	/// [Child-Pays-For-Parent](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp) fee bumping technique. This
	/// child transaction must include the anchor input described within `anchor_descriptor` along
	/// with additional inputs to meet the target feerate. Failure to meet the target feerate
	/// decreases the confirmation odds of the transaction package (which includes the commitment
	/// and child anchor transactions), possibly resulting in a loss of funds. Once the transaction
	/// is constructed, it must be fully signed for and broadcast by the consumer of the event
	/// along with the `commitment_tx` enclosed. Note that the `commitment_tx` must always be
	/// broadcast first, as the child anchor transaction depends on it.
	///
	/// The consumer should be able to sign for any of the additional inputs included within the
	/// child anchor transaction. To sign its anchor input, an [`InMemorySigner`] should be
	/// re-derived through [`KeysManager::derive_channel_keys`] with the help of
	/// [`AnchorDescriptor::channel_keys_id`] and [`AnchorDescriptor::channel_value_satoshis`]. The
	/// anchor input signature can be computed with [`EcdsaChannelSigner::sign_holder_anchor_input`],
	/// which can then be provided to [`build_anchor_input_witness`] along with the `funding_pubkey`
	/// to obtain the full witness required to spend.
	///
	/// It is possible to receive more than one instance of this event if a valid child anchor
	/// transaction is never broadcast or is but not with a sufficient fee to be mined. Care should
	/// be taken by the consumer of the event to ensure any future iterations of the child anchor
	/// transaction adhere to the [Replace-By-Fee
	/// rules](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/policy/mempool-replacements.md)
	/// for fee bumps to be accepted into the mempool, and eventually the chain. As the frequency of
	/// these events is not user-controlled, users may ignore/drop the event if they are no longer
	/// able to commit external confirmed funds to the child anchor transaction.
	///
	/// The set of `pending_htlcs` on the commitment transaction to be broadcast can be inspected to
	/// determine whether a significant portion of the channel's funds are allocated to HTLCs,
	/// enabling users to make their own decisions regarding the importance of the commitment
	/// transaction's confirmation. Note that this is not required, but simply exists as an option
	/// for users to override LDK's behavior. On commitments with no HTLCs (indicated by those with
	/// an empty `pending_htlcs`), confirmation of the commitment transaction can be considered to
